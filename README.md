# GoogleMapsAPIs-and-StreetView-to-Navigate-Kenya

The Application uses GoogleMaps APIs, JavaScript API,
and the StreetView to provide locations and places to
visit in Kenya.

The Application provides a map of Kenya and the neighbourhood
areas that one can visit, example trending and new restaurants,
museums, and water parks..

The Application uses map markers to identify popular locations and
places around Kenya that one would like to visit.

The application also provides a 360 street view of the places for
the tourists to familiarize themselves with the streets and buildings
close to these places.

Using a serach button and suggested listviews of the places, the tourist
can easily get recommendations of other new places to visit.

The next ste is to implement another feature that will further provide the
users with reviews from other reviewers regarding the places using third-party APIs.
