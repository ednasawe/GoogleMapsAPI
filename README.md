# GoogleMapsAPIs-and-StreetView-to-Navigate-Kenya

- The Application uses **GoogleMaps APIs, JavaScript API**,andthe
**StreetView** to provide locations and places to visit in Kenya.

- The Application provides a map of Kenya and the neighbourhood
areas that one can visit, example trending and new restaurants,
museums, and water parks, etc.

- The Application uses map markers to identify popular locations
and places around Kenya that one would like to visit.

- The application also provides a 360 street view of the places
for the tourists to familiarize themselves with the streets and
buildings close to these places.

- Using a serach button and suggested listviews of the places,the
tourist can easily get recommendations of other new places to visit.

- The next ste is to implement another feature that will further provide
the users with reviews from other reviewers regarding the places using _third-party APIs._
